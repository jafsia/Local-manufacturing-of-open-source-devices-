## Revisit contribution guidelines and documentation plan

This project is open so that anyone can get involved, and you don't have to learn 3D design to help (although that would be great). Ways you can contribute include:

- Share your sthetoscope  images 
- Raise an issue if you spot something that's wrong, or something that could be improved. This includes the instructions/documentation.
- Suggest better text or images for the instructions.
- Improve the design of parts 
- Fork it, and make pull requests 
- Things in need of attention are currently described in issues so have a look there if you'd like to work on something but aren't sure what.
