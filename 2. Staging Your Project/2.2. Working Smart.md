# Do some research on projects similar to yours!
## To avoid reinventing the wheel, and once you have defined the purpose of your project, go out there and look for open hardware projects that you can use as references.

## Maybe you found a proof of principle for a function you need? There is some usability feature you’d like to incorporate, or you found a project you love and you’d like to make a derivative for your own needs?

## Make a list of at least 3 projects, including project name, link to documentation, and a short note of why that project is useful for you.
