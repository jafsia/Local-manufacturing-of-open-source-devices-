## The situation
The high cost of modern stethoscopes remains a significant barrier to physicians
and allied health professionals practicing in low- and middle-income countries,
where few affordable high-quality options exist. Stethoscopes in general are hard
to sterilize resulting in a use model where cheap stethoscopes are acquired by the
hospital/clinic and one is assigned to each patient, with every professional who
works with that patient using the same stethoscope. This can result in crosscontamination as someone touches many stethoscopes. Cheap stethoscopes also
wear out quickly and have short hoses, resulting in professionals getting
physically closer to the patient than necessary, particularly if they have to put their
arm around the patient and listen to positions on the back.
## The objective
The objective is to be able to limit the prolonged contact of the nursing staff with
the patient and to have a device which can be placed by the patient but interpreted
by the practitioner.
## The solution
3D technologies have recently proven their efficiency and speed in the medical
sector, allowing many projects to see the light of day during the COVID-19 crisis.
Faced with the shortage of certain medical equipment and devices, makers,
manufacturers, services and players in the 3D printing sector have mobilized to
3D print respirators, protective visors, swabs and connected devices to facilitate
medical teleconsultations.In line with this new paradigm, we propose to design
an open-source wireless 3D printed Digital Stethoscope.
